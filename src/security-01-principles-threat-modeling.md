# Security Principles and Threat Modeling

## Introduction

Security principles and threat modeling form the foundation of building secure software systems. This section explores fundamental security concepts, systematic approaches to identifying threats, and methodologies for designing resilient systems that can withstand attacks.

## Fundamental Security Principles

### The CIA Triad

The CIA triad is the cornerstone of information security:

**Confidentiality**
- Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized individuals
- Implementing access controls, encryption, and authentication mechanisms
- Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized disclosure

**Integrity**
- Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data
- Preventing unauthorized modification of data or systems
- Implementing checksums, digital signatures, and audit trails

**Availability**
- Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed
- Implementing redundancy, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery
- Protecting against denial-of-service attacks and system failures

### Defense in Depth

Defense in depth involves multiple layers of security controls:

**Layered Security Architecture**
- Network security (firewalls, IDS/IPS)
- Host security (hardening, patching)
- Application security (input validation, secure coding)
- Data security (encryption, access controls)
- Physical security (data center protection)

**Benefits of Defense in Depth**
- No single point of failure
- Multiple opportunities to detect and prevent attacks
- Compensating controls when one layer fails
- Reduced attack surface

### Least Privilege Principle

The principle of least privilege states that entities should only have the minimum permissions necessary:

**Implementation Strategies**
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Just-in-time access provisioning
- Regular permission reviews and revocation

**Examples**
- Database users with read-only access when possible
- Service accounts with minimal required permissions
- Developers without production access
- Temporary elevated privileges with audit trails

### Fail-Secure Design

Systems should fail in a secure state:

**Design Considerations**
- Default deny rather than default allow
- Secure failure modes for critical systems
- Graceful degradation under attack
- Preservation of security during system failures

**Implementation Examples**
- Authentication systems that deny access on failure
- Network connections that drop on security violations
- Applications that log security events before crashing

## Threat Modeling Methodologies

### STRIDE Model

STRIDE is a threat modeling framework developed by Microsoft:

**Spoofing**
- Definition: Impersonating another user or system
- Examples: Stolen credentials, fake websites, email spoofing
- Mitigations: Strong authentication, certificate validation

**Tampering**
- Definition: Unauthorized modification of data or systems
- Examples: Man-in-the-middle attacks, data injection
- Mitigations: Data integrity checks, digital signatures

**Repudiation**
- Definition: Ability to deny performing an action
- Examples: Lack of audit trails, anonymous transactions
- Mitigations: Comprehensive logging, non-repudiation services

**Information Disclosure**
- Definition: Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- Examples: Data breaches, insecure storage, network sniffing
- Mitigations: Encryption, access controls, data masking

**Denial of Service**
- Definition: Preventing legitimate users from accessing systems
- Examples: DDoS attacks, resource exhaustion
- Mitigations: Rate limiting, redundancy, capacity planning

**Elevation of Privilege**
- Definition: Gaining higher permissions than intended
- Examples: Privilege escalation, exploitation of vulnerabilities
- Mitigations: Principle of least privilege, input validation

### PASTA Model

Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA):

**Phase 1: Define Objectives**
- Business objectives and compliance requirements
- Technical and security objectives
- Success criteria for security measures

**Phase 2: Define Technical Scope**
- Application architecture and components
- Data flows and trust boundaries
- Integration points and external dependencies

**Phase 3: Application Decomposition**
- Detailed analysis of application components
- Data classification and sensitivity
- Entry points and attack surfaces

**Phase 4: Threat Analysis**
- Identify potential threats and attack vectors
- Analyze threat likelihood and impact
- Prioritize threats based on risk assessment

**Phase 5: Vulnerability Analysis**
- Identify existing vulnerabilities
- Assess exploitability and potential impact
- Map vulnerabilities to threats

**Phase 6: Attack Simulation**
- Simulate real-world attack scenarios
- Test security controls and defenses
- Identify gaps in security posture

**Phase 7: Risk Analysis and Mitigation**
- Calculate risk scores and prioritize remediation
- Develop mitigation strategies
- Create security requirements and recommendations

### DREAD Model

DREAD is a risk assessment model for evaluating threats:

**Damage Potential**
- How much damage could this threat cause?
- Rating: High (3), Medium (2), Low (1)

**Reproducibility**
- How easy is it to reproduce the attack?
- Rating: High (3), Medium (2), Low (1)

**Exploitability**
- How much effort is required to exploit?
- Rating: High (3), Medium (2), Low (1)

**Affected Users**
- How many users are affected?
- Rating: High (3), Medium (2), Low (1)

**Discoverability**
- How easy is it to discover the vulnerability?
- Rating: High (3), Medium (2), Low (1)

## Risk Assessment and Prioritization

Effective security requires continuous attention throughout the system lifecycle, from initial design through deployment and operations. By making security an integral part of the development process rather than an afterthought, teams can build systems that protect critical assets and maintain trust with users.
