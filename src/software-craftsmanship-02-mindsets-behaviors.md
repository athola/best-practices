# Mindsets & Behaviors

The personal characteristics and collaborative practices of exceptional engineers are just as important as their technical skills. These mindsets and behaviors enable engineers to work effectively with others, take ownership of their work, and continuously improve their craft.

## Ownership and Follow-through

Top engineers take responsibility for their work from conception to deployment and beyond. They don't consider code "done" until it's working in production and they've addressed any issues that arise. They ship features and follow up on bugs until they're proud of the result.

### What Ownership Looks Like

**End-to-End Responsibility**
- They take ownership of features from requirements gathering through deployment and maintenance
- They monitor their code in production and respond to issues promptly
- They don't consider their work complete until users are successfully using it
- They take responsibility for fixing bugs and addressing feedback

**Proactive Problem Solving**
- They anticipate potential issues and address them before they become problems
- They follow up on deployed features to ensure they're working as expected
- They take initiative to improve systems they're responsible for
- They don't wait for others to identify problems—they actively seek them out

**Quality Standards**
- They hold themselves to high standards of quality and reliability
- They test their work thoroughly before considering it complete
- They document their code and decisions for future maintainers
- They take pride in their work and strive for excellence

### Developing Ownership Mindset

**Think Like an Owner**
- Consider the long-term impact of your decisions
- Take responsibility for the success of your projects

- Keep track of issues and follow through until they're resolved

**Build Accountability**
- Communicate clearly about what you're responsible for
- Admit mistakes and take responsibility for fixing them
- Learn from failures and share lessons with the team
- Celebrate successes and acknowledge contributions

## Humility and Collaboration

Despite their expertise, top engineers remain humble. They're willing to admit when they're wrong, learn from others (including junior engineers), and give credit where it's due. They focus on finding the best solution rather than proving their solution is best.

### The Power of Humility

**Intellectual Humility**

- They build an environment where everyone can contribute their best

### Developing Collaborative Skills

**Practice Active Listening**
- Focus on understanding others before responding
- Ask questions to clarify and deepen your understanding
- Pay attention to non-verbal communication
- Summarize what you've heard to ensure understanding

**Give Constructive Feedback**
- Focus on specific behaviors and outcomes, not personal attributes
- Balance positive feedback with areas for improvement
- Provide feedback in a timely and private manner when appropriate
- Suggest specific actions for improvement

**Build Psychological Safety**
- Create an environment where people feel safe to share ideas
- Encourage diverse perspectives and constructive debate
- Admit your own mistakes and vulnerabilities
- Support team members when they take risks or make mistakes

## Reading Source Code

- They take pride in solutions that others can easily understand

**Pragmatic Approach**
- They choose the simplest solution that meets the requirements
- They avoid over-engineering and premature optimization
- They understand when good enough is better than perfect
- They balance simplicity with the need for future flexibility

### Principles of Simple Design
