# Monitoring and Observability

## Overview

Monitoring and observability are essential for understanding system behavior, detecting issues, and maintaining operational excellence. Effective monitoring provides visibility into system performance, while observability enables deep analysis of system behavior through metrics, logs, and traces.

## Monitoring Philosophy

"Monitoring tells you when something is wrong; observability helps you understand why. The most effective systems combine both approaches to provide comprehensive visibility into system behavior."

### Monitoring Principles

**Principle 1: Monitor What Matters**
"Don't monitor everythingâ€”monitor what matters. Focus on metrics that directly impact user experience and business outcomes."

**Principle 2: Make Monitoring Actionable**
"Every alert should have a clear action. If you can't act on an alert, it's just noise."

**Principle 3: Design for Observability**
"Build observability into your systems from the beginning. Don't treat it as an afterthought."

**Principle 4: Context is King**
"Monitoring without context is just data. Provide context to make monitoring meaningful."

**Principle 5: Continuous Improvement**
"Monitoring is not static. Continuously refine your monitoring based on incidents and changing requirements."

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Metric Collection

**Metrics Collection Framework**
```python
# Recommended approach for metrics collection
class MetricsCollector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics_registry = MetricsRegistry()
        self.metric_exporters = []
        self.sampling_rate = 1.0
    
    def register_metric(self, metric):
        """Register metric for collection"""
        self.metrics_registry.register(metric)
    
    def add_exporter(self, exporter):
        """Add metric exporter"""
        self.metric_exporters.append(exporter)
    
    def collect_metrics(self):
        """Collect all registered metrics"""
        metrics = {}
        
        for metric_name, metric in self.metrics_registry.get_metrics():
            if random.random() < self.sampling_rate:
                metrics[metric_name] = metric.collect()
        
        return metrics
    
    def export_metrics(self, metrics):
        """Export metrics to all configured exporters"""
        for exporter in self.metric_exporters:
            try:
                exporter.export(metrics)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to export metrics to {exporter.name}: {e}")
```

### Alerting Strategies

**Alerting Framework**
```python
# Recommended approach for alerting
class AlertingManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.alert_rules = []
        self.alert_channels = []
        self.alert_history = AlertHistory()
        self.deduplicator = AlertDeduplicator()
    
    def add_alert_rule(self, rule):
        """Add alert rule"""
        self.alert_rules.append(rule)
    
    def add_alert_channel(self, channel):
        """Add alert channel"""
        self.alert_channels.append(channel)
    
    def evaluate_alerts(self, metrics):
        """Evaluate all alert rules against metrics"""
        alerts = []
        
        for rule in self.alert_rules:
            try:
                alert = rule.evaluate(metrics)
                if alert:
                    # Check for duplicates
                    if not self.deduplicator.is_duplicate(alert):
                        alerts.append(alert)
                        self.deduplicator.record_alert(alert)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to evaluate alert rule {rule.name}: {e}")
        
        # Send alerts
        for alert in alerts:
            self._send_alert(alert)
            self.alert_history.record_alert(alert)
        
        return alerts
    
    def _send_alert(self, alert):
        """Send alert to all channels"""
        for channel in self.alert_channels:
            try:
                channel.send(alert)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to send alert to {channel.name}: {e}")
```

## Logging Strategies

### Structured Logging

**Structured Logging Framework**
```python
# Recommended approach for structured logging
class StructuredLogger:
    def __init__(self, name, level=logging.INFO):
        self.name = name
        self.level = level
        self.handlers = []
        self.context = {}
    
    def add_handler(self, handler):
        """Add log handler"""
        self.handlers.append(handler)
    
    def add_context(self, **kwargs):
        """Add context to all log messages"""
        self.context.update(kwargs)
    
    def log(self, level, message, **kwargs):
        """Log structured message"""
        if level < self.level:
            return
        
        # Create structured log entry
        log_entry = {
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            'level': logging.getLevelName(level),
            'logger': self.name,
            'message': message,
            'context': {**self.context, **kwargs}
        }
        
        # Send to all handlers
        for handler in self.handlers:
            try:
                handler.handle(log_entry)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to handle log entry: {e}")
```

## Distributed Tracing

### Trace Collection

**Distributed Tracing Framework**
```python
# Recommended approach for distributed tracing
class TracingManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tracer = Tracer()
        self.span_processors = []
        self.sampling_rate = 1.0
    
    def add_span_processor(self, processor):
        """Add span processor"""
        self.span_processors.append(processor)
    
    def start_span(self, name, context=None):
        """Start new span"""
        if random.random() > self.sampling_rate:
            return NoopSpan()
        
        span = self.tracer.start_span(name, context)
        return span
    
    def finish_span(self, span):
        """Finish span and send to processors"""
        if isinstance(span, NoopSpan):
            return
        
        span.finish()
        
        for processor in self.span_processors:
            try:
                processor.process(span)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to process span: {e}")
```

## Observability Patterns

### The Three Pillars

**Metrics, Logs, and Traces Integration**
```python
# Recommended approach for integrating the three pillars
class ObservabilityPlatform:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics_collector = MetricsCollector()
        self.log_aggregator = LogAggregator()
        self.tracing_manager = TracingManager()
        self.correlation_manager = CorrelationManager()
    
    def correlate_events(self, time_window=300):
        """Correlate events across metrics, logs, and traces"""
        # Get recent events
        metrics = self.metrics_collector.get_recent_metrics(time_window)
        logs = self.log_aggregator.get_recent_logs(time_window)
        traces = self.tracing_manager.get_recent_traces(time_window)
        
        # Correlate events
        correlations = self.correlation_manager.correlate(
            metrics=metrics,
            logs=logs,
            traces=traces
        )
        
        return correlations
```
