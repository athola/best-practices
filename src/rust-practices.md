# Rust Engineering Best Practices

This chapter covers patterns and practices that consistently deliver reliable results in production Rust environments. These practices help teams avoid common pitfalls and build more maintainable systems.

## Chapter Overview

This chapter is organized into the following sections:

- **[What Actually Matters](rust-practices-01-what-matters.md)** - Core principles that distinguish Rust development from other languages
- **[Project Structure](rust-practices-02-project-structure.md)** - Workspace organization, crate structure, and module patterns
- **[Configuration Management](rust-practices-03-configuration.md)** - Build profiles, feature flags, and environment configuration
- **[Testing](rust-practices-04-testing.md)** - Fast testing frameworks, test organization, and performance benchmarks
- **[CI/CD Pipeline](rust-practices-05-cicd.md)** - Workflow structure, security scanning, and custom security rules
- **[Performance Optimization](rust-practices-06-performance.md)** - Build profiles, runtime performance, and memory optimization
- **[Security](rust-practices-07-security.md)** - Production hardening and security best practices
- **[Documentation](rust-practices-08-documentation.md)** - Inline documentation and module documentation patterns
- **[Error Handling](rust-practices-09-error-handling.md)** - Structured error types and result type aliases
- **[Async Patterns](rust-practices-10-async.md)** - Concurrent processing and resource management

Each section builds upon the previous ones, creating a comprehensive framework for understanding and implementing effective Rust engineering practices across different types of projects and development contexts.

The journey to Rust excellence is not about following rigid rulesâ€”it's about developing the judgment, skills, and mindset to make appropriate engineering decisions in any context. By mastering these practices, you'll be better equipped to write Rust code that is not only functional but also maintainable, performant, and a pleasure to work with.
