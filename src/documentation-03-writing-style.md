# Writing Style Guidelines

## Active Voice Preference

Use active voice to create clear, direct, and engaging documentation. Active voice makes it clear who performs actions and reduces ambiguity.

### Passive Voice (Avoid):
> "The configuration file is updated by the system administrator."

### Active Voice (Preferred):
> "The system administrator updates the configuration file."

### When to Use Passive Voice:

- When the actor is unknown or irrelevant
- In scientific writing where the process matters more than the actor
- To emphasize the recipient of an action rather than the performer

## Consistent Terminology

Maintain consistent terminology throughout your documentation. Inconsistent terminology confuses readers and makes documentation harder to search and understand.

### Terminology Best Practices:

- **Create a glossary** of key terms and use them consistently
- **Avoid synonyms** for technical concepts—choose one term and stick with it
- **Define acronyms** on first use and use them consistently thereafter
- **Use industry-standard terms** when available rather than creating new terminology

### Example Terminology Consistency:
```
Use: "user authentication" consistently
Avoid: mixing "user authentication," "user login," "user sign-in"

Use: "API endpoint" consistently  
Avoid: mixing "API endpoint," "API route," "API URL"
```

## Ambiguous Pronoun Avoidance

Eliminate ambiguous pronouns that create confusion about what specific noun a pronoun refers to.

### Ambiguous (Avoid):
> "The server connects to the database. It should be configured properly."

### Clear (Preferred):
> "The server connects to the database. The server should be configured properly."

### Strategies for Eliminating Ambiguity:

- **Repeat the noun** instead of using pronouns when clarity is critical
- **Restructure sentences** to avoid pronoun references
- **Use specific nouns** rather than vague references

## Concise and Scannable Content

Write concisely and structure content for easy scanning. Most readers scan documentation rather than reading it word-for-word.

### Conciseness Techniques:

- **Eliminate redundant phrases** ("in order to" → "to")
- **Use simple words** instead of complex ones ("utilize" → "use")
- **Remove filler words** ("very," "really," "quite")
- **Break long sentences** into shorter, clearer ones

### Scannable Content Structure:

- **Use headings and subheadings** to create visual hierarchy
- **Employ bullet points** for lists and key information
- **Include tables** for comparative information
- **Highlight important terms** using bold or code formatting
- **Keep paragraphs short** (3-5 sentences maximum)

## Clarity and Precision

Write with clarity and precision to ensure readers understand exactly what you mean.

### Precision Guidelines:

- **Use specific numbers** instead of vague terms ("5 minutes" vs. "a few minutes")
- **Avoid ambiguous terms** like "recently," "soon," or "better"
- **Define technical terms** when first introduced
- **Provide examples** to illustrate abstract concepts

### Clarity Techniques:

- **Use simple sentence structure** (subject-verb-object)
- **Avoid nested clauses** and complex sentence constructions
- **Place modifiers close** to the words they modify
- **Use parallel structure** for lists and comparisons

## Tone and Voice

Maintain a consistent, professional tone throughout your documentation.

### Tone Guidelines:

- **Be helpful and supportive** rather than authoritarian
- **Use second person** ("you") to address readers directly
- **Avoid humor and sarcasm** that may not translate well
- **Maintain objectivity** and avoid personal opinions

### Voice Consistency:

- **Establish a consistent voice** across all documentation
- **Match the tone** to the audience and content type
- **Avoid switching between formal and informal** styles
- **Consider cultural differences** in communication styles
