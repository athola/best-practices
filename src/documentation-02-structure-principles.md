# Structure Principles

Based on Google's Technical Writing Guide research, effective documentation follows specific structural principles that enhance usability and comprehension.

## Clear Scope Definition

Every document should begin with a clear definition of its scope and purpose. This helps readers quickly determine if the document addresses their needs and sets appropriate expectations for the content.

### Essential Scope Elements:

- **Purpose Statement**: What this document accomplishes
- **Target Audience**: Who should read this document
- **Prerequisites**: What readers need to know before starting
- **Scope Boundaries**: What the document does and does not cover

### Example Scope Structure:
```markdown
## Scope
This guide explains how to configure authentication for the API gateway. It covers basic setup, advanced configuration options, and troubleshooting common issues.

## Audience
This guide serves developers and system administrators responsible for implementing API authentication. Readers should have basic understanding of REST APIs and security concepts.

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with HTTP and REST concepts
- Access to the API gateway administration interface
- Understanding of authentication fundamentals (OAuth, JWT, API keys)
```

## Key Point Summaries

Front-load important information by providing key points or summaries at the beginning of each section. This accommodates readers who scan content and helps them quickly grasp the main concepts.

### Effective Summary Structure:

- **Main Takeaway**: The single most important point
- **Key Benefits**: What the reader will gain
- **Critical Considerations**: Important caveats or requirements
- **Next Steps**: What the reader should do after reading

## Logical Content Organization

Organize content in a logical progression that builds understanding incrementally. Follow these patterns:

### From General to Specific

- Start with high-level concepts and progress to detailed implementation
- Provide context before diving into technical specifics
- Use examples to illustrate abstract concepts

### From Simple to Complex

- Begin with basic use cases and advance to complex scenarios
- Introduce foundational concepts before dependent topics
- Layer information to avoid overwhelming readers

### Task-Oriented Structure

- Organize content around user goals and tasks
- Group related information by user workflow
- Provide clear pathways for different user needs

## Visual Hierarchy

Create visual hierarchy to guide readers through your content:

### Heading Structure

- Use consistent heading levels (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
- Ensure headings are descriptive and meaningful
- Avoid skipping heading levels (e.g., H1 directly to H3)

### Content Formatting

- Use bullet points for lists and key information
- Employ numbered lists for sequential steps
- Include tables for comparative information
- Highlight important terms using bold or code formatting
- Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences maximum)

### Navigation Aids

- Include a table of contents for longer documents
- Provide internal links for easy navigation
- Use breadcrumbs to show content hierarchy
- Include related content suggestions

## Progressive Disclosure

Reveal information progressively to avoid overwhelming readers:

### Layered Information

- Start with essential information
- Provide links to detailed explanations
- Use expandable sections for advanced topics
- Separate conceptual content from procedural instructions

### Reading Paths

- Design for different reading patterns (scanning, skimming, deep reading)
- Provide quick-start guides for immediate needs
- Include comprehensive references for detailed study
- Offer multiple entry points based on user expertise
