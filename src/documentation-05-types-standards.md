# Documentation Types and Standards

## Code Comments

Code comments serve as inline documentation for developers working directly with the codebase.

### Effective Code Comment Principles:

- **Explain "why" rather than "what"**â€”the code itself shows what it does
- **Document design decisions** and trade-offs
- **Provide context** for complex algorithms or business logic
- **Include usage examples** for non-obvious functions

### Comment Types:
```javascript
// Function-level comment: Purpose and usage
/**
 * Validates user input against security requirements.
 * @param {string} input - The user input to validate
 * @returns {boolean} True if input meets security requirements
 * @throws {ValidationError} If input contains malicious content
 */

// Inline comment: Explains non-obvious logic
const sanitizedInput = input.replace(/<script\b[^<]*(?:(?!<\/script>)<[^<]*)*<\/script>/gi, '');
// Remove script tags to prevent XSS attacks while preserving other HTML
```

### Comment Best Practices:

- **Keep comments current** with code changes
- **Use consistent formatting** across the codebase
- **Avoid obvious comments** that repeat what the code already shows
- **Write for future maintainers** who may not have context
- **Include TODO and FIXME markers** for temporary solutions

## API Documentation

API documentation serves developers who need to integrate with your software components.

### Essential API Documentation Elements:

- **Endpoint descriptions** with HTTP methods and URLs
- **Parameter specifications** including types, requirements, and validation rules
- **Request/response examples** in multiple formats (JSON, XML)
- **Authentication and authorization** requirements
- **Error handling** with status codes and error message formats
- **Rate limiting** and usage restrictions

### API Documentation Structure:
```markdown
## Authentication
All API requests require authentication using Bearer tokens.

## Endpoints

### GET /api/users
Retrieves a list of users with optional filtering.

**Parameters:**
- `limit` (integer, optional): Maximum number of users to return
- `offset` (integer, optional): Number of users to skip for pagination
- `role` (string, optional): Filter users by role

**Response:**
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "123",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "role": "developer"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "limit": 10,
  "offset": 0
}
```
```

### API Documentation Best Practices:

- **Provide interactive examples** that users can test
- **Include error scenarios** and how to handle them
- **Document versioning** and deprecation policies
- **Use consistent naming conventions** across endpoints
- **Include performance considerations** and limitations

## User Guides and Tutorials

User guides help end users successfully adopt and utilize your software features.

### Effective User Guide Structure:

- **Goal-oriented organization** around user tasks and objectives
- **Step-by-step procedures** with clear numbered instructions
- **Screenshots and diagrams** to illustrate complex processes
- **Prerequisites and requirements** clearly stated
- **Troubleshooting sections** for common issues

### Tutorial Best Practices:

- **Start with simple examples** and progress to complex scenarios
- **Provide working code samples** that users can run immediately
- **Include expected outputs** for each step
- **Offer multiple learning paths** for different experience levels

### User Guide Components:

**Getting Started:**
- Installation and setup instructions
- Basic configuration steps
- First-use examples and quick wins

**Feature Deep Dives:**
- Detailed explanations of individual features
- Advanced configuration options
- Best practices and optimization tips

**Troubleshooting:**
- Common issues and solutions
- Error message explanations
- Debugging and diagnostic procedures

## Architecture Documentation

Architecture documentation communicates system design decisions and technical approaches to technical stakeholders.

### Architecture Documentation Components:

- **System overview** with high-level architecture diagrams
- **Design decisions** and trade-off analysis
- **Component interactions** and data flow descriptions
- **Technology choices** and justification
- **Scalability and performance** considerations
- **Security architecture** and threat models

### Architecture Documentation Types:

**High-Level Architecture:**
- System context diagrams
- Component relationships
- Data flow overview
- Integration points

**Detailed Design:**
- Component specifications
- Interface definitions
- Data models and schemas
- Algorithm descriptions

**Operational Documentation:**
- Deployment procedures
- Monitoring and alerting
- Backup and recovery
- Performance tuning

### Architecture Documentation Best Practices:

- **Use visual diagrams** to complement text descriptions
- **Document rationale** behind design decisions
- **Include non-functional requirements** and how they're addressed
- **Provide context** for technical choices
- **Keep documentation synchronized** with actual implementation

## Technical Specifications

Technical specifications provide detailed requirements and implementation guidelines for specific features or components.

### Specification Components:

- **Functional requirements** and user stories
- **Technical constraints** and limitations
- **Interface specifications** and contracts
- **Performance requirements** and SLAs
- **Security requirements** and compliance needs

### Specification Best Practices:

- **Be specific and measurable** in requirements
- **Include acceptance criteria** for each requirement
- **Document dependencies** and prerequisites
- **Provide examples** and edge cases
- **Review and validate** specifications with stakeholders
