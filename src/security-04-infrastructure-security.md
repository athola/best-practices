### Privileged Access Management
- **Privileged Account Management**: Secure and monitor privileged accounts
- **Session Recording**: Record privileged sessions for audit purposes
- **Password Vaulting**: Use password vaults for shared credentials
- **Emergency Access**: Implement break-glass procedures for emergency access

## Security Monitoring and Logging

### Log Management
- **Centralized Logging**: Collect logs from all systems in a central location
- **Log Retention**: Implement appropriate log retention policies
- **Log Analysis**: Use SIEM tools for log analysis and correlation
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor logs in real-time for security events

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- **Event Correlation**: Correlate events across multiple systems
- **Threat Detection**: Use machine learning for threat detection
- **Automated Response**: Implement automated response to security events
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate compliance reports from SIEM data

### Intrusion Detection
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity
- **Host Monitoring**: Monitor individual systems for compromise indicators
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Analyze user and system behavior patterns
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integrate threat intelligence feeds

## Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

### Backup and Recovery
- **3-2-1 Rule**: Keep 3 copies, on 2 different media, with 1 off-site
- **Regular Testing**: Test backup restoration procedures regularly
- **Encryption**: Encrypt backups both in transit and at rest
- **Versioning**: Maintain multiple versions of critical data

### High Availability
- **Redundancy**: Implement redundant systems and components
- **Load Balancing**: Use load balancers to distribute traffic
- **Failover Testing**: Regularly test failover procedures
- **Geographic Distribution**: Distribute systems across geographic regions

### Incident Response
- **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and maintain an incident response plan
- **Response Team**: Establish an incident response team
