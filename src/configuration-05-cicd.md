# Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) automates the build and testing process, forming a critical component of modern configuration management. CI ensures that code changes are automatically built, tested, and validated, providing rapid feedback to developers and maintaining code quality throughout the development lifecycle.

## CI Pipeline Components

A typical CI pipeline consists of several interconnected components that work together to automate the software delivery process:

graph TD
    A[Code Commit] --> B[Build]
    B --> C[Unit Tests]
    C --> D[Integration Tests]
    D --> E[Code Analysis]
    E --> F[Deploy to Staging]
    F --> G[Approval]
    G --> H[Deploy to Production]
