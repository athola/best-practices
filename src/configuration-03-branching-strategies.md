# Branching Strategies

Effective branching strategies are crucial for team coordination. They define how teams organize their work, manage features, and maintain code quality throughout the development lifecycle.

## Feature Branch Workflow

The feature branch workflow is one of the most common and straightforward approaches to branching.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit
    branch feature
    checkout feature
    commit
    commit
    checkout main
    merge feature
    commit
```

### How It Works

**Process:**
1. Create a new branch for each feature from the main branch
2. Work on the feature in isolation on the feature branch
3. Merge the feature branch back to main when complete
4. Delete the feature branch after successful merge

### Best Practices

**Branch Management**
- Keep branches focused on single features
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`)
- Regularly sync with main branch to avoid conflicts
- Delete branches after merging to keep repository clean

**Development Practices**
- Make small, frequent commits on feature branches
- Ensure code is tested before merging
- Use pull requests for code review
- Keep branches short-lived (days or weeks, not months)

**Team Coordination**
- Communicate branch creation and completion
- Use branch protection rules for main branch
- Implement continuous integration on feature branches
- Have clear merge criteria and processes

### When to Use Feature Branch Workflow

**Ideal For:**
- Small to medium teams
- Projects with clear feature boundaries
- Teams practicing continuous integration
- Projects with moderate release frequency

**Less Suitable For:**
- Very large teams with complex coordination needs
- Projects requiring multiple simultaneous releases
- Teams needing strict release management
- Organizations with formal change control processes

## GitFlow Workflow

GitFlow is a more structured approach with multiple branch types designed for larger projects and teams.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial"
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit id: "Feature prep"
    branch feature/login
    checkout feature/login
    commit id: "Login feature"
    checkout develop
    merge feature/login
    commit id: "After login"
    branch release/1.0
    checkout release/1.0
    commit id: "Release prep"
    checkout main
    merge release/1.0
    checkout develop
    merge release/1.0
```

### Branch Types and Their Purposes

**main**
- Contains production-ready code
- Tags for releases are created here
- Protected branch with restricted access
- Always stable and deployable

**develop**
- Integration branch for features
- Contains latest developed features
- Next release candidate
- Should always be buildable and testable

**feature/**
- Feature development branches
- Created from and merged back to develop
- Multiple feature branches can exist simultaneously
- Short-lived branches for specific features

**release/**
- Release preparation branches
- Created from develop when preparing for release
- Bug fixes, documentation updates, release metadata
- Merged to both main and develop when complete

**hotfix/**
- Emergency fixes for production issues
- Created from main (production)
- Merged to both main and develop
- Critical fixes that can't wait for next release

### GitFlow Process

**Feature Development**
1. Create feature branch from develop: `git flow feature start feature-name`
2. Work on feature in isolation
3. Complete feature: `git flow feature finish feature-name`
4. Feature is merged back to develop

**Release Preparation**
1. Create release branch from develop: `git flow release start version`
2. Perform release preparation (bug fixes, docs, version bump)
3. Complete release: `git flow release finish version`
4. Release is merged to main and tagged, develop is updated

**Hotfix Process**
1. Create hotfix branch from main: `git flow hotfix start version`
2. Implement emergency fix
3. Complete hotfix: `git flow hotfix finish version`
4. Fix is merged to main and develop, main is tagged

### Advantages of GitFlow

**Structured Approach**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Defined roles for different branch types
- Professional release management
- Suitable for enterprise environments

**Release Management**
- Parallel development and release preparation
- Ability to stabilize releases without blocking development

## GitHub Flow

GitHub Flow is a simpler, more lightweight workflow designed for continuous deployment.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit
    branch feature
    checkout feature
    commit
    commit
    checkout main
    merge feature
    commit
```

### Key Principles

**Everything in main**
- main branch is always deployable
- Features are developed in branches
- Pull requests for all changes
- Continuous deployment from main

**Simple Process**
1. Create branch from main
