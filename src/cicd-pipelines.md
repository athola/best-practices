# CI/CD Pipelines

## Scope

This chapter provides comprehensive guidance on designing, implementing, and maintaining continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. It covers pipeline architecture, automation strategies, testing integration, deployment patterns, and operational considerations that determine development velocity and software quality.

## Audience

This chapter serves DevOps engineers, software engineers, team leads, and engineering managers involved in automating software delivery processes. Junior engineers will learn foundational CI/CD concepts and practices, mid-level engineers will discover effective pipeline design patterns, and senior engineers will find advanced strategies for complex deployment scenarios and operational excellence.

## Key Points

- **CI/CD automation accelerates delivery** while maintaining quality through automated testing and deployment
- **Pipeline design should match team context**—different approaches work for different project types and organizational structures
- **Testing integration is critical**—automated quality gates ensure reliability while maintaining development velocity
- **Deployment strategies require careful planning**—different patterns serve different reliability and speed requirements
- **Pipeline monitoring enables continuous improvement**—observability and metrics drive pipeline optimization

CI/CD pipelines represent the automation backbone of modern software development, enabling teams to deliver changes rapidly and reliably while maintaining quality standards and operational stability.
